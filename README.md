# Run it
* python ./iat.py
* Take the test
* run calcIAT.py to see result, note that if there are mutliple result files in the directory calcIAT.py reads and calculates them all, which is nice if you want to get bulk scores and store them somewhere.

# Updates by Sonny Parlin
* Converted code for Python 3
* added calcIAT.py to calculate the result files created by iat.py
